# prime-number-generator
This project was made by SIdTheLoser and is still being maintained by him (what a CHAD!).
## How will this be useful to me?
You can use the "primes.dat" and pickle library to get a list of prime numbers which you can use to make appropriate programs with (I don't care how you will use my program).
## How do I help?
Download the "main.py" file and the latest "primes.dat" file provided and put them both in one directory, go to town generating prime numbers!
## How do I help optimise the code?
Download the "main.py" file and tell me if you made any improvements by communicating with me by my provided contacts in my profile.
